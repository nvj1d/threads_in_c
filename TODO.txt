diff between process and threads
race conditions? --> too many operations (!!) // on multi core precessor
 ---> mutex lock & unlock --> protect a part of code
 // try to separate creating and joining the th (not the same loop) --> will be one at the time!
 // th number of processes depends on the numbers of cps cores
 // to pass a value from the thread function to the main you can allocate the value return then pthread_join(,(void **)res )--> free it
